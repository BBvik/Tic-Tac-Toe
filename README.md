# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is one of my biggest projects so far. The PC always starts its move on the center of the board witht an "X". The way that you choose your move is by selecting a number from the board and a "O" will be put on the board. Every turn the program checks if somebody won and if no one wins after 9 turns the game ends with a tie.
